# Guess_the_number
A simple number-guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number within a given range, and the player has to guess it within limited attempts. 
  The program provides hints (too high/too low) until the correct number is guessed or attempts run out.

## Features:
  - Random number generation
  - Player guess input
  - Hints: too high / too low
  - Limited attempts ("lives")
  - Win or lose message at the end

## Technologies:
  - Python 3 (no external libraries required)
    
## Usage: 
  Run the code:<br> [Run the code â†’ GUESS THE NUMBER.py](./GUESS%20THE%20NUMBER.py) <br>
  Follow on-screen instructions and try to guess the secret number!

## Future_uses:
  - Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
  - Allow the player to choose their own number range
  - Add a scoreboard to track wins and losses
  - Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
  - Multiplayer mode where players compete to guess first
